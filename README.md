# R-Pi-PICO-playground

A collection of simple MicroPython scripts for learning about microcontrollers and having fun.

I use a Raspberry Pi Pico W with the following hardware:
- SH1106 OLED (I2C) display
- PIR sensor
- Potentiometer
- LEDs and wires

## Setup

1. Install MicroPython on your Raspberry Pi Pico W [(link)](https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO2_W/)
2. In VS Code, install the Raspberry Pi Pico extension [(link)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=raspberry-pi.raspberry-pi-pico)
